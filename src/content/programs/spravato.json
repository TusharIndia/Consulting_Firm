    "content": {
      "paragraph1": "Spravato infusions are important for stabilizing mental health conditions and improving quality of life for individuals with severe depression. This therapy offers rapid symptom relief, which is particularly crucial for individuals at risk of self-harm or those who have experienced limited success with conventional medications. By working differently than traditional antidepressants, Esketamine targets glutamate receptors in the brain, promoting faster and more effective recovery.",
      "paragraph2": "For individuals with co-occurring conditions, Spravato infusions complement other mental health treatments, providing a holistic and comprehensive path to recovery. This innovative therapy supports long-term adherence to treatment plans, helping patients achieve sustained relief and enhanced daily functioning. Patients undergoing Spravato treatment experience significant improvement in depressive symptoms, making it a transformative option for those who have struggled with other therapies."
