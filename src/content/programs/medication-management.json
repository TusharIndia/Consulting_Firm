      "paragraph1": "The medications used in the Medication Management program offer a wide range of options tailored to treat various mental health conditions and co-occurring disorders. These treatments play a vital role in stabilizing symptoms and improving overall functioning. Common prescriptions include antidepressants such as SSRIs and SNRIs , which are effective for managing depression, anxiety, and PTSD. Antianxiety medications are also used to reduce symptoms of anxiety and panic disorders.\n",
      "paragraph2": "For individuals dealing with mood disorders, mood stabilizers like Lithium and Depakote help maintain emotional balance, especially in cases of bipolar disorder. Antipsychotic medications are often prescribed for conditions like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and episodes of severe psychosis. Additionally, for patients with co-occurring substance use disorders, medications like Naltrexone or Buprenorphine support recovery by addressing both addiction and mental health simultaneously."
