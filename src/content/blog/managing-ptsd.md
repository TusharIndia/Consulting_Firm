PTSD can make you feel stuck in survival mode long after the danger has passed. You might relive traumatic events, avoid people or places, or struggle with sleep and emotional numbness.

It begins after a traumatic experience, like war, abuse, or serious accidents, that overwhelms your ability to cope.

## What Is PTSD?

Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)is **a mental health condition that develops after you experience or witness a traumatic event.** This could be a life-threatening situation, severe accident, natural disaster, combat exposure, sexual assault, or repeated abuse. 

PTSD is more than just feeling upset after trauma; it involves lasting psychological distress that interferes with your daily life. According to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, About 6% of the U.S. population will experience PTSD at some point in their lives.
